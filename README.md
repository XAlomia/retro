# retro
analysis, research and visualizations from retrosheet data 

The retrosheet data is too large to add to github, I have it named in these files retro_events.csv 
Please make sure the files retro_events.csv are in this directory, to process them I recommend 
using another directory since there will be many files to process to make the .csv

I will provide instructions on how I proccesed it.
